# homer speech app

Android App used as interface for android speech synthesis and speech recogntion
and ROS. Communication is done via Sockets on 2 different ports.

For ROS integration are the acompanioned ros nodes needed.

Note: this system is in an early development process and currently not supported 
by ourself because we don't use it and thus  is meant as a proof of concept to enable
robots natural voice interaction the quick & easy way. In comparison to professional
software products this is also a quite cheap approach for speech recognition and
synthesis.
